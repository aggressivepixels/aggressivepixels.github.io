The result rolling my face over the keyboard two days in a row

<!-- end excerpt -->

Hello world! After about two days of rolling my face over the keyboard, I've
finally managed to get something decent working. The post you're reading
right now was generated by a generator built from scratch. It's rough, the
code is rather messy, the CSS probably sucks and I'd love to get rid of
the HTML templates and use something like
[Elm's `Html` package](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/html/latest/),
but I'm happy with the result overall.

I'll write a post eventually about all the things I don't like about it and
what tools I plan to use in the next iteration of it.

The source code can be found
[here](https://github.com/aggressivepixels/aggressivepixels.github.io), but
don't read it just yet! Wait a couple of days until I fix some of the mess.
